# EasyEat
EasyEat simplifies meal planning by offering a centralized recipe database where users can add, search and manage recipes collaboratively. With secure user authentication, it allows easy access and management, while future updates will introduce admin-only recipe deletion to maintain database integrity. EasyEat is built with Python, Streamlit, and uses Google Sheets for data storage, with API access managed through Google Cloud Console. The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for quick accessibility.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Google Sheets (Database)
- Google Cloud Console (API Access Management)

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Tools
- [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud): For deploying and hosting the application.
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/): For managing API access to Google Sheets.

## üí° What I Learned
- **Python & Streamlit Development:** Gained deeper experience building web applications with Streamlit and integrating third-party libraries.
- **Google Cloud & Sheets Integration:** Learned how to manage API access via Google Cloud Console and integrate Google Sheets as a lightweight database solution.
- **Authentication in Streamlit:** Integrated secure user authentication using the Streamlit-Authenticator module, improving my understanding of user management.
- **Collaborative Platform Development:** Built a system that handles multiple users interacting with the same recipe database, which helped me understand collaborative workflows in web apps.

## üîÆ Future Improvement Ideas
- **Admin Controls for Deletion:** Restrict recipe deletion to admin users only.
- **User-specific Recipe Collections:** Allow users to create their own collections or favorite recipes.
- **Google Sheets API Rate Limits**: The app may experience occasional delays or errors when multiple users interact with the database simultaneously, due to Google Sheets API rate limits. This issue resolves automatically after a short period. An improvement to optimize API usage is planned in a future release.

## üí≠ Sources and Inspiration
My understanding of building web apps with Streamlit and integrating external APIs was greatly improved by various resources:
  - [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
  - [Streamlit-Authenticator](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator)
  - [Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs?hl=en)
  - [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)


## :vertical_traffic_light: Running the Project
To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps: 
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxitech/easy_eat.git
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   cd easy_eat
   python -m venv venv
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. **Install the Required Dependencies:** Install all necessary Python packages using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Set Up Google Authentication:**
   - Inside the `src` folder, create a `.streamlit` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/.streamlit
   ```
   - Within this directory, create a `secrets.toml` file and include your Google authentication credentials:
   ```toml
   [google]
   application_credentials = '''{your_downloaded_credentials.json}'''

   db_credentials = '''{your_downloaded_db_credentials.json}'''
   ```
 6. **Configure Local Development:**
    For local development, you need to update the path to `config.yaml` in the `config.py` module located in the `utils` folder. Open `src/utils/config.py` and change the path to:
    ```python
    config_path = '../config.yaml'
    ```
 7. **Navigate to the `src` Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
 8. **Start the Local Development Server:** Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
 9. **Open** [http://localhost:5801](http://localhost:5801) (or the address shown in your console) in your web browser to view the app.
